# 🛡️ Phishing Analyzer

![Phishing Analyzer Cover](images/title.png)

This is a hybrid multi-agent phishing email analysis system, where deterministic security agents perform detection and scoring, and LLM agents are used strictly for explanation. Orchestration is handled via Prefect.

---
Real-World Cybersecurity Impact

- This system demonstrates how multi-agent AI can improve phishing detection in real-world security environments.
- Helps security teams automatically analyze suspicious emails
- Reduces manual phishing investigation time
- Provides explainable phishing risk scoring
- Allows human analysts to validate decisions before blocking emails
- The architecture reflects how modern Security Operations Centers (SOC) combine automated detection, AI reasoning, and human oversight to prevent phishing attacks safely.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture

This project implements a structured multi-agent phishing detection system where specialized agents collaborate to analyze suspicious emails and generate a final security assessment.

### 1️⃣ Detection Agent
Performs deep phishing detection by analyzing:
- Email headers and sender anomalies  
- Email content and phishing indicators  
- Domain intelligence and age  
- SPF, DKIM, and DMARC authentication  

This agent produces structured technical findings from the email.

---

### 2️⃣ Risk Scoring Agent
Calculates the overall phishing risk score based on signals generated by the Detection Agent.

Responsibilities:
- Assigns phishing severity level (Low, Medium, High)  
- Determines recommended action (Allow, Flag, Quarantine, Block)  
- Produces final risk assessment  

---

### 3️⃣ Explanation Agent (CrewAI)
Generates a human-readable explanation of the phishing analysis for security analysts and non-technical stakeholders.

- Uses CrewAI to simulate a SOC security analyst  
- Explains why an email was classified with a given risk  
- Improves transparency and interpretability  

This agent is optional at runtime but remains an integral part of the multi-agent architecture.

---

### 4️⃣ Human Review Agent (Human-in-the-Loop)
Implements a human validation step before final action is taken.

- Allows a security analyst to approve, block, or escalate  
- Prevents fully autonomous decision-making  
- Ensures safe deployment in real-world environments  

---

### 🔄 Orchestration
All agents are orchestrated using a Prefect workflow that coordinates execution, ensures reliability, and manages the end-to-end phishing analysis pipeline.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

This system analyzes suspicious emails using a coordinated multi-agent pipeline that combines deterministic phishing detection, risk scoring, AI explanation, and human validation.

Each agent performs a specialized role to ensure reliable and explainable phishing detection.

---

## 🔄 Agent Workflow

The system follows a structured multi-agent workflow:

1. **Email Ingestion**  
   Loads and parses email data from `.eml` files.

2. **Detection Agent**  
   Analyzes headers, content, domains, and authentication signals to identify phishing indicators.

3. **Risk Scoring Agent**  
   Calculates overall phishing risk score and determines severity and recommended action.

4. **Human Review Agent (Human-in-the-Loop)**  
   Allows a security analyst to approve, block, or escalate the decision before final output.

5. **Explanation Agent (CrewAI)**  
   Generates a human-readable explanation of the analysis for analysts and stakeholders.

This structured workflow ensures reliable phishing detection while maintaining transparency and human oversight.

---
## 🧠 Why a Multi-Agent Approach?

Instead of relying on a single AI model, this system separates responsibilities across specialized agents:

- Detection Agent focuses on technical phishing indicators  
- Risk Agent ensures consistent scoring and decisions  
- Explanation Agent improves transparency  
- Human Review Agent adds safety and oversight  

This separation improves reliability, explainability, and real-world deployability of AI-driven phishing detection systems.
